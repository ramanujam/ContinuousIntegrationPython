# Continuous Integration Python using CircleCI

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/ramanujam/ContinuousIntegrationPython.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/ramanujam/ContinuousIntegrationPython)

This simple project shows how you can use continous integration with python in your teams.

You need the following to make this work - 
1. A git account
2. CircleCI account linked to your git account

Both have a free tier that you can use.

Once you have the setup done, you can clone the repo and integrate into your repo. If setup properly, you can see that status of your build in the CircleCI interface.

I strongly recommend going through the article in the reference to understand the idea of continuous integration.
